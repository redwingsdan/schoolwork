4 platters, 256 cylinders, 256 sectors, 128 bytes/sector
capacity = 4platter * 2surface/platter * 256cylinders * 256sectors * 128bytes = 64MB

cache hit rate 90%, memory hit rate 95%. Prob of word from disk
(1-0.9)*(1-0.95) = 0.5%

Two programs with 30% IO waiting each, CPU utilization
1-.03 * 0.3 or 1 - p^n = 91%

Swapping system where memory is holes, next fit from location

Dining philosophers is array of semaphores

mutex lock needs cmp register @ #1 to #0 if move mutex is #0

Kernel mode disable interrupts, set time, change memory. User can read time clock

Process states are running, ready, blocked

If each program can access memory:
one can run at a time, jump must be modified to new location, and might wipe out critical regions of OS

Advantage of segmentation:
handle data structures to grow and shrink, changing size of procedure does not affect other procedures
size still cannot exceed memory space and running speed is not improved
