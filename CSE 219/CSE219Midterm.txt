MultiThreading
Deadlock
concurrent modification exception (crash JVM) if both threads try to access thread @ once
Reentrant lock to fix (call locka nd unlock manually)
or use synchronized keytword on object (Anything in that block will lock object, so only 1 thread cna use at once)
problem is starvation, if a lot try to do one thing and one thread hogging the lock then threads starve
ONLY SMALL BLOCKS HAVE LOCKS (So nothing gets backlogged)
live lock is stuff is happening(infinite loop basically) so harder to catch

MOSTLY CONCEPTS(SHORT ANSWER STUFF, MAYBE SOME CODE)
For calling functions (variable is in STACK, the place in memory the data is, is in HEAP)
