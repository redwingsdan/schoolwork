Open the 'FollowMe' project in Android Studio and sync the gradle. Ensure that the proper build tools, SDK, and APIs are installed.
The necessary API keys have been included in the project.
When the project is run, either use a virtual emulator or any android device to run the app.

After the app is running:

There is a menu at the start to either go to the map or set an alarm time.

Set an alarm time to set the time for when you want to arrive at your destination. The current time is displayed below the entered arrival time.

Go to the map to set your destination.

Once the destination is chosen the map will update with the fastest route to your destination and display the distance and time to get to the location as well as the arrival time if the user entered one.

When the current time plus the time to get to the destination is equal to the arrival time, a notification will appear to inform the user that it is time to leave.

NOTE:
Sometimes there is a bug that crashes the app when leaving the map to go back to the menu and then returning to the map.
