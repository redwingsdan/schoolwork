The three numbers are 16, 33, and 51

The goal is to find the maximum loss while using these three money values. There are 7 different
states where money can be lost:

State 1: price between $1 and first value
State 2: price between first value and second value
State 3: price greater than second value, less than third value, and within $firstvalue of the second value
State 4: price greater than second value, less than third value and greater than $firstvalue of the second value
State 5: price greater than third value and within $firstvalue of the third value
State 6: price greater than third value and greater than $firstvalue but within $secondvalue of the third value
State 7: price greater than third value and greater than $secondvalue.

Using my numbers as an example:

$1 = state 1 because 1 < 16
$17 = state 2 because 16 < 17 < 33
$34 = state 3 because 33 < 34 < (16+33) < 51
$50 = state 4 because 33 < (16+33) < 50 < 51
$52 = state 5 because 51 < 52 < (51+16)
$68 = state 6 because 51 < (51+16) < 68 < (51+33)
$85 = state 7 because 51 < (51+33) < 85 < 100

Using these values, we can obtain the maximum loss from each state:

State 1 = $15
State 2 = $16
State 3 = $15
State 4 = $1
State 5 = $15
State 6 = $16
State 7 = $15

So the maximum loss incurred is $16. This appears to be the lowest loss based on repeated attempts with alternative numbers.
